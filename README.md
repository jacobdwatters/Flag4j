# Flag4j - Fast Linear Algebra for Java
Flag4j is a fast and easy to use linear algebra library for Java and provides operations and linear algebra routines for real/complex sparse/dense tensors, matrices, and vectors.

## State of Project as of 7-DEC-2024
Flag4j is currently in the final steps of development before an initial beta release. 
Nearly all features have been fully implemented or beta implementations.

### Recent Updates:
- I/O Improvements:
  - All tensors, vectors, and matrices may be serialized.
  - Added support for reading/writing from/to Matrix Market Exchange file formats.
    - Currently only supports a subset including real/complex/integer dense general matrices 
    and real/complex/integer coordinate general matrices
  - Added support for reading/writing from/to csv files for real and complex matrices (i.e. `Matrix` and `CMatrix`).
- Improved API: There have been significant changes to the API specifically with the inheritance hierarchy of arrays (tensors, 
  matrices, vectors). This was in part to serve the creation of general field/ring/semiring tensors.
- New Algebraic Structures and Generic Tensors:
  - Added `Field`, `Ring`, and `Semiring` interfaces representing the mathematical objects.
    - Complex numbers are now implemented as a `Field`. There are now 64-bit and 128-bit variants of complex numbers.
    - Several reference implementations of the interfaces are provided, e.g. `Bool`, `RealInt16`, `Complex128`.
  - Added generic `FieldMatrix<T extends Field<T>>` for creating matrices for a generic field. This allows users
  to easily create a matrix for a custom field which implements the `Field` interface. Support for generic 
  ring and semiring matrices are planed.
