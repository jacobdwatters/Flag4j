/**
 * <p>The {@code RandomComplex} class provides methods to generate pseudorandom complex numbers under a variety of
 * distributions and constraints. This class supports both {@link Complex128} and {@link Complex64}.
 *
 * <p>Distributions supported by this class include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Uniformly distributed random complex numbers on the unit disk, within annular regions, or rectangular regions
 *         of the complex plane.</li>
 *     <li>Gaussian distributed random complex numbers, including standard circular, elliptical, and
 *         bivariate Gaussian distributions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Example Usage:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * RandomComplex randomComplex = new RandomComplex();
 *
 * // Generate a random complex number with a magnitude between 0 and 1.
 * Complex128 randomOnDisk = randomComplex.randomComplex128();
 *
 * // Generate a random complex number with a magnitude between 1 and 2.
 * Complex128 randomInAnnulus = randomComplex.randomComplex128(1, 2);
 *
 * // Generate a Gaussian-distributed random complex number centered at (0, 0)
 * //   with standard distributions of 1 along both real and imaginary axis and
 * //   a correlation coefficient between real and imaginary values of 0.5.
 * Complex64 gaussianComplex = randomComplex.randnComplex64(0, 1, 0, 1, 0.5f);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: This class extends {@link Random}. As such instances of {@code RandomComplex} are threadsafe.
 * However, the concurrent use of the same {@code RandomComplex}
 * instance across threads may encounter contention and consequent poor performance.
