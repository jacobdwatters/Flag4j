/**
 * <p>Solves a well determined system of equations <span class="latex-inline">Ax = b</span> or <span class="latex-inline">AX = B</span>
 * in an exact sense by using a
 * {@link ComplexLU LU decomposition}
 * where <span class="latex-inline">A</span>, <span class="latex-inline">B</span>, and <span class="latex-inline">X</span>
 * are matrices, and <span class="latex-inline">x</span> and <span class="latex-inline">b</span> are vectors.
 *
 * <p>If the system is not well determined, i.e. <span class="latex-inline">A</span> is not square or not full rank, then use a
 * {@link org.flag4j.linalg.solvers.lstsq.ComplexLstsqSolver least-squares solver}.
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <p>A single system may be solved by calling either {@link ExactSolver#solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)} or
 * {@link ExactSolver#solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)}.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this solver may also be used to efficiently solve many systems of the form <span class="latex-inline">Ax = b</span>
 * or <span class="latex-inline">AX = B</span>
 * for the same coefficient matrix <span class="latex-inline">A</span> but numerous constant vectors/matrices
 * <span class="latex-inline">b</span> or <span class="latex-inline">B</span>. To do this, the workflow
 * would be as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Create an instance of {@code ComplexExactSolver}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link ExactSolver#decompose(MatrixMixin) decompse(A)} once on the coefficient matrix
 *     <span class="latex-inline">A</span>.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link ExactSolver#solve(VectorMixin) solve(b)} or {@link ExactSolver#solve(MatrixMixin)
 *     solve(B)} as many times as needed to
 *     solve each
 *     system for with the various <span class="latex-inline">b</span> vectors and/or
 *     <span class="latex-inline">B</span> matrices. </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Any call made to one of the following methods after a call to
 * {@link ExactSolver#decompose(MatrixMixin) decompse(A)} will
 * override the coefficient matrix set that call:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ExactSolver#solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ExactSolver#solve(MatrixMixin, MatrixMixin)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Specialized solvers are provided for inversion using {@link ExactSolver#solveIdentity(MatrixMixin)}. This should be preferred
 * over calling on of the other solve methods and providing an identity matrix explicitly.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the coefficient matrix in the linear system.
 * @param <U> The type of vector in the linear system.
