/**
 * <p>Solves a well determined system of equations <span class="latex-inline">Ax = b</span> or 
 * <span class="latex-inline">AX = B</span> in an exact sense.
 * <p>If the system is not well determined, i.e. <span class="latex-inline">A</span> is not square or not full rank, then use a
 * {@link org.flag4j.linalg.solvers.lstsq.LstsqSolver least-squares solver}.
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <p>A single system may be solved by calling either {@link #solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)} or
 * {@link #solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)}.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this solver may also be used to efficiently solve many systems of the form
 * <span class="latex-inline">Ax = b</span> or <span class="latex-inline">AX = B</span>
 * for the same coefficient matrix <span class="latex-inline">A</span> but numerous constant vectors/matrices
 * <span class="latex-inline">b</span> or <span class="latex-inline">B</span>. To do this, the workflow
 * would be as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Create a concrete instance of {@code LinearMatrixSolver}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin) decompse(A)} once on the coefficient matrix <span class="latex-inline">A</span>.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #solve(VectorMixin) solve(b)} or {@link #solve(MatrixMixin) solve(B)} as many times as needed to solve each
 *     system for with the various <span class="latex-inline">b</span> vectors and/or
 *     <span class="latex-inline">B</span> matrices. </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Any call made to one of the following methods after a call to
 * {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin) decompse(A)} will
 * override the coefficient matrix set that call:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #solve(MatrixMixin, VectorMixin)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #solve(MatrixMixin, MatrixMixin)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Specialized solvers are provided for inversion using {@link #solveIdentity(MatrixMixin)}. This should be preferred
 * over calling on of the other solve methods and providing an identity matrix explicitly.
 * 
 * <h2>Implementation Notes:</h2>
 * The
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the coefficient matrix in the linear system.
 * @param <U> The type of vector in the linear system.
