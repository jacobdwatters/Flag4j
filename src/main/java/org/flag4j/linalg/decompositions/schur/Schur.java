/**
 * <p>An abstract base class for computing the Schur decomposition of a square matrix.
 *
 * <p>The Schur decomposition decomposes a given square matrix <b>A</b> into:
 * <pre>
 *     <b>A = UTU</b><sup>H</sup></pre>
 * where <b>U</b> is a unitary (or orthogonal for real matrices) matrix <b>T</b> is a
 * quasi-upper triangular matrix known as the <em>Schur form</em> of <b>A</b>. This means <b>T</b> is upper triangular except
 * for possibly 2&times;2 blocks along its diagonal, which correspond to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues.
 *
 * <p>The Schur decomposition proceeds by an iterative algorithm with possible random behavior. For reproducibility, constructors
 * support specifying a seed for the pseudo-random number generator.
 *
 * <h3>Usage:</h3>
 * The decomposition workflow typically follows these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Instantiate a con concrete instance of {@code Schur}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin)} to perform the factorization.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieve the resulting matrices using {@link #getU()} and {@link #getT()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Efficiency Considerations:</h3>
 * If eigenvectors are not required, setting {@code computeU = false} <em>may</em> improve performance.
 *
 * <p>This class was inspired by code from the <a href="http://ejml.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">EJML</a>
 * library and the description of the Francis implicit double shifted QR algorithm from
 * <a href="https://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/watkins/books.html">Fundamentals of Matrix
 * Computations 3rd Edition by David S. Watkins</a>.
 *
 * @implNote This decomposition is performed using the <b>implicit double-shift QR algorithm</b>, which iteratively
 * reduces the matrix to Schur form using orthogonal transformations. In addition to this, random shifting is used in cases where
 * normal convergence fails.
 *
 * <p>As a preprocessing step to improve conditioning and stability, the matrix is first {@link Balancer balanced} then reduced to
 * <b>Hessenberg form</b> via a {@link UnitaryDecomposition}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of matrix to be decomposed.
 * @param <U> The type for the internal storage data structure of the matrix to be decomposed.
