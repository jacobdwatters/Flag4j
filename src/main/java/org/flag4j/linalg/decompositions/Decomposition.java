/**
 * <p>An abstract base class representing a matrix decomposition.
 *
 * <p>This class provides a foundation for various matrix decompositions,
 * such as LU, QR, SVD, Schur, and Hessenburg decompositions. Implementing classes must define
 * the decomposition process by overriding the {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin)} method.
 *
 * <h3>Usage:</h3>
 * <p>A typical workflow using a decomposition class follows these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Instantiate a concrete implementation of a decomposition.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin)} to perform the decomposition and a specific matrix.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieve decomposition results via additional getter methods provided by the subclass.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>State Management:</h3>
 *
 * <p>The class maintains an internal state flag, {@code hasDecomposed}, which tracks whether
 * a matrix decomposition has been performed. This ensures that methods depending on the
 * decomposition can verify its existence before proceeding. The {@link #ensureHasDecomposed()}
 * method is provided to enforce this check. Below is a minimal example usage of {@link #ensureHasDecomposed()} for
 * a LU decomposition.
 * <pre>{@code
 * class RealLU extends Decomposition<Matrix> {
 *     Matrix L;
 *     Matrix U;
 *     // Other fields and constructors...
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public RealLU decompose(Matrix a) {
 *         // LU implementation...
 *         super.hasDecomposed = true;
 *         return this;
 *     }
 *
 *     public Matrix getL() {
 *         super.ensureHasDecomposed();
 *         return L;
 *     }
 *
 *     public Matrix getU() {
 *         super.ensureHasDecomposed();
 *         return U;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of matrix that this decomposition operates on.
