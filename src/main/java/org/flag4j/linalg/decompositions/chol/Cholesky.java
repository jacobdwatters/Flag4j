/**
 * <p>An abstract base class for Cholesky decomposition of symmetric (or Hermitian) positive-definite matrices.
 *
 * <p>The Cholesky decomposition factorizes a symmetric/Hermitian, positive-definite matrix <b>A</b> as:
 * <pre>
 *     <b>A = LL<sup>H</sup></b></pre>
 * where <b>L</b> is a lower triangular matrix.
 * The decomposition is primarily used for efficient numerical solutions to linear systems, computing matrix inverses,
 * and generating samples from multivariate normal distributions.
 *
 * <h3>Hermitian Verification:</h3>
 * <p>This class provides an option to explicitly check whether the input matrix is Hermitian. If {@code enforceHermitian} is set
 * to {@code true}, the implementation will verify that <b>A</b> satisfies <b>A = A<sup>H</sup></b> before performing decomposition.
 * If set to {@code false}, the matrix is assumed to be Hermitian, no explicit check will be performed, and only the lower-diagonal
 * entries of <b>A</b> are accessed.
 *
 * <h3>positive-definiteness Check:</h3>
 * <p>To ensure numerical stability, the algorithm verifies that all diagonal entries of <b>L</b> are positive.
 * A tolerance threshold, {@code posDefTolerance}, is used to determine whether a diagonal entry is considered
 * non-positive, indicating that the matrix is <em>not</em> positive-definite. This threshold can be adjusted using
 * {@link #setPosDefTolerance(double)}.
 *
 * <h3>Usage:</h3>
 * <p>A typical workflow using a concrete implementation of Cholesky decomposition follows these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Instantiate a subclass of {@code Cholesky}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(MatrixMixin)} to compute the decomposition.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieve the factorized matrices using {@link #getL()} or {@link #getLH()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of matrix on which the Cholesky decomposition is performed, extending {@link MatrixMixin}.
 *
 * @see Decomposition
 * @see MatrixMixin
 * @see #setPosDefTolerance(double)
