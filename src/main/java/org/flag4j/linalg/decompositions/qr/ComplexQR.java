/**
 * <p>Computes the QR decomposition of dense complex matrix.
 *
 * <p>The QR decomposition factorizes a given matrix <b>A</b> into the product of an orthogonal matrix <b>Q</b>
 * and an upper triangular matrix <b>R</b>, such that:
 * <pre>
 *     A = QR</pre>
 *
 * <p>The decomposition can be computed in either the <em>full</em> or <em>reduced</em> form:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Reduced QR decomposition:</b> When {@code reduced = true}, the decomposition produces a compact form where
 *         <b>Q</b> has the same number of rows as <b>A</b> but only as many columns as the rank of <b>A</b>.</li>
 *     <li><b>Full QR decomposition:</b> When {@code reduced = false}, the decomposition produces a square orthogonal matrix
 *         <b>Q</b> with the same number of rows as <b>A</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * The decomposition workflow typically follows these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Instantiate an instance of {@code RealQR}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(CMatrix)} to perform the factorization.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieve the resulting matrices using {@link #getQ()} and {@link #getR()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @implNote This class extends {@link ComplexUnitaryDecomposition} and provides implementations for computing the
 * QR decomposition efficiently. The decomposition uses Householder transformations to iteratively
 * zero out sub-diagonal entries while maintaining numerical stability.
 *
 * @see ComplexUnitaryDecomposition
 * @see #getR()
 * @see #getQ()
