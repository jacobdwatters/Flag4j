/**
 * <p>Computes the Hessenberg decomposition of a real dense square matrix.
 * <p>The Hessenberg decomposition decomposes a given square matrix <span class="latex-inline">A</span> into the product:
 * <span class="latex-display"><pre>
 *     A = QHQ<sup>T</sup></pre></span>
 * where <span class="latex-inline">Q</span> is an orthogonal matrix and <span class="latex-inline">H</span> is an upper Hessenberg matrix, which is similar to 
 * <span class="latex-inline">A</span>
 * (i.e., it has the same eigenvalues).
 *
 * <p>A matrix <span class="latex-inline">H</span> is in upper Hessenburg form if it is nearly upper triangular. Specifically,
 * if <span class="latex-inline">H</span> has
 * all zeros below the first sub-diagonal.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following matrix is in upper Hessenburg form where each '<span class="latex-inline">&times;</span>'
 * may hold a different value:
 * <span class="latex-replaceable"><pre>
 *     [[ &times; &times; &times; &times; &times; ]
 *      [ &times; &times; &times; &times; &times; ]
 *      [ 0 &times; &times; &times; &times; ]
 *      [ 0 0 &times; &times; &times; ]
 *      [ 0 0 0 &times; &times; ]]</pre> </span>
 *
 * <!-- LATEX: \[ \begin{bmatrix}
 * \times & \times & \times & \times & \times \\
 * \times & \times & \times & \times & \times \\
 * 0 & \times & \times & \times & \times \\
 * 0 & 0 & \times & \times & \times \\
 * 0 & 0 & 0 & \times & \times
 * \end{bmatrix} \] -->
 *
 * <h2>Efficiency Considerations:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If the orthogonal matrix <span class="latex-inline">Q</span> is not required, setting {@code computeQ = false} in the constructor
 *     <em>may</em> improve performance.</li>
 *     <li>Support for in-place decomposition to reduce memory usage.</li>
 *     <li>Support for decomposition of matrix sub-blocks, enabling efficient eigenvalue computations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * The decomposition workflow typically follows these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Instantiate an instance of {@code RealHess}.</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #decompose(Matrix)} to perform the factorization.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieve the resulting matrices using {@link #getH()} and {@link #getQ()}.</li>
 * </ol>
