/**
 * <p>Base class for all decompositions which implement matrix balancing. Balancing a matrix involves computing a
 * diagonal similarity transformation to "balance" the rows and columns of the matrix. This balancing is achieved
 * by attempting to scale the entries of the matrix by similarity transformations such that the 1-norms of corresponding
 * rows and columns have the similar 1-norms. Rows and columns may also be permuted during balancing if requested.
 *
 * <p>Balancing is often used as a preprocessing step to improve the conditioning of eigenvalue problems. Because the
 * balancing transformation is a similarity transformation, the eigenvalues are preserved. Further, when permutations are
 * done during balancing it is possible to isolate decoupled eigenvalues.
 *
 * <p>The similarity transformation of a square matrix A into the balanced matrix B can be described as:
 * <pre>
 *     B = T<sup>-1</sup> A T
 *       = D<sup>-1</sup> P<sup>-1</sup> A P D.</pre>
 * Solving for A, balancing may be viewed as the following decomposition:
 * <pre>
 *     A = T B T<sup>-1</sup>
 *       = P D B D<sup>-1</sup> P<sup>-1</sup>.</pre>
 * Where P is a permutation matrix, and D is a diagonal scaling matrix.
 *
 * <p>When permutations are used during balancing we obtain a specific form. First,
 * <pre>
 *           <sup>  </sup>[ T<sub>1</sub>  X   Y  ]
 *   P<sup>-1</sup> A P = [  0  B<sub>1</sub>  Z  ]
 *           <sup>  </sup>[  0  0   T<sub>2</sub> ]</pre>
 * Where T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie along the diagonal. These are also
 * eigenvalues of A. Then, if scaling is applied we obtain:
 * <pre>
 *               <sup>    </sup>[ T<sub>1</sub>     X*D<sub>1</sub>       Y   ]
 *   D<sup>-1</sup> P<sup>-1</sup> A P D = [  0  D<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>*B<sub>1</sub>*D<sub>1</sub>  D<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>*Z  ]
 *               <sup>    </sup>[  0      0         T<sub>2</sub>  ]</pre>
 *
 * $$ \begin{bmatrix}
 * T_1 & XD_1 & Y \\
 * \mathbf{0} & D_1^{-1}B_1D_1 & D_1^{-1}Z \\
 * \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & T_2
 * \end{bmatrix}  $$
 *
 * Where D<sub>1</sub> is a diagonal matrix such that,
 * <pre>
 *         [ I<sub>1</sub> 0  0  ]
 *     D = [ 0  D<sub>1</sub> 0  ]
 *         [ 0  0  I<sub>2</sub> ]</pre>
 * Where I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> are identity matrices with equivalent shapes to T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.
 *
 * <p>Once balancing has been applied, one need only compute the eigenvalues of B<sub>1</sub> and combine them with the diagonal
 * entries of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> to obtain all eigenvalues of A.
 *
 * <p>The code in this class if heavily based on LAPACK's reference implementations of
 * <a href=https://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/df/df3/group__gebal.html>xGEBAL</a> (v 3.12.1).
