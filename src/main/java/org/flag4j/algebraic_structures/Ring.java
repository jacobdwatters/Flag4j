/**
 * Defines a mathematical ring structure and specifies the operations that ring elements must support.
 *
 * <p>A <b>ring</b> is an algebraic structure consisting of a set <b>R</b> equipped with two binary operations:
 * addition (+) and multiplication (*). Rings generalize {@link Field fields} by not requiring every non-zero element to have a
 * multiplicative inverse, and multiplication may not be commutative.
 *
 * <h2>Formal Definition:</h2>
 * <p>For all elements {@code a}, {@code b}, and {@code c} in <b>R</b>, the following properties must hold:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Addition is associative:</b> {@code a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Addition is commutative:</b> {@code a + b = b + a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Additive identity exists:</b> There exists an element {@code 0} in <b>R</b> such that {@code a + 0 = a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Existence of additive inverses:</b> For every {@code a} in <b>R</b>, there exists an element {@code -a}
 *   in <b>R</b> such that {@code a + (-a) = 0}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplication is associative:</b> {@code a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Distributivity of multiplication over addition:</b>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li><b>Left distributivity:</b> {@code a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)}</li>
 *       <li><b>Right distributivity:</b> {@code (a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Implementations:</h2>
 * <p>Implementations of the {@code Ring} interface should ensure that instances are immutable. This means
 * that all operations should return new instances rather than modifying existing ones. Immutability guarantees
 * thread safety and consistent behavior across different contexts.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #compareTo(Semiring)} method should implement some ordering (total or partial) on the semiring.
 *
 * <p>Further, implementations should ensure that the equality and hash code methods are consistent with the semiring's equality
 * definition.
 *
 * <h2>Interface Methods:</h2>
 * <p>The {@code Ring} interface specifies the following methods that ring elements must implement:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #add(Semiring)}: Performs the addition operation, returning a new ring element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #mult(Semiring)}: Performs the multiplication operation, returning a new ring element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #sub(Ring)}: Performs the subtraction operation, defined as addition with the additive inverse.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #addInv()}: Returns the additive inverse of this element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isZero()}: Checks if the element is the additive identity (zero element).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isOne()}: Checks if the element is the multiplicative identity (one element), if it exists.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getZero()}: Returns the additive identity element of the ring.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getOne()}: Returns the multiplicative identity element of the ring, if it exists.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Assume T is a concrete implementation of Ring<T>
 * T a = ...; // Initialize element a
 * T b = ...; // Initialize element b
 *
 * T sum = a.add(b);        // Perform addition in the ring
 * T difference = a.sub(b); // Perform subtraction in the ring
 * T product = a.mult(b);   // Perform multiplication in the ring
 * T negation = a.addInv(); // Get the additive inverse of a
 *
 * boolean isZero = a.isZero(); // Check if a is the additive identity
 * boolean isOne = b.isOne();   // Check if b is the multiplicative identity
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Examples of Rings:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Integers (ℤ):</b> The set of integers with usual addition and multiplication forms a ring.</li>
 *   <li><b>Polynomials:</b> Polynomials with coefficients in a field form a ring under polynomial addition and multiplication.</li>
 *   <li><b>Matrix Rings:</b> Square matrices of a given size over a ring form a ring under matrix addition and multiplication.</li>
 * </ul>

 * @param <T> the type of the ring element.
