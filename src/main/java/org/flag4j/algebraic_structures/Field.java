/**
 * Defines a mathematical field structure and specifies the operations that field elements must support.
 *
 * <p>A <b>field</b> is an algebraic structure consisting of a set <b>F</b> equipped with two binary operations:
 * addition (+) and multiplication (*). Fields generalize the familiar arithmetic of rational numbers, real numbers,
 * and complex numbers. In a field, both addition and multiplication are commutative, and every non-zero element has
 * a multiplicative inverse, allowing for division operations.
 *
 * <h2>Formal Definition:</h2>
 * <p>For all elements {@code }, {@code b}, and {@code c} in <b>F</b>, the following properties must hold:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Addition is associative:</b> {@code a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Addition is commutative:</b> {@code a + b = b + a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Additive identity exists:</b> There exists an element {@code 0} in <b>F</b> such that {@code a + 0 = a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Existence of additive inverses:</b> For every {@code a} in <b>F</b>, there exists an element {@code -a}
 *   in <b>F</b> such that {@code a + (-a) = 0}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplication is associative:</b> {@code a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplication is commutative:</b> {@code a * b = b * a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplicative identity exists:</b> There exists an element {@code 1 ‚â† 0} in <b>F</b> such that
 *   {@code a * 1 = a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Existence of multiplicative inverses:</b> For every {@code a ‚â† 0} in <b>F</b>, there exists an element
 *   <code>a<sup>-1</sup></code> in <b>F</b> such that <code>a * a<sup>-1</sup> = 1</code></li>
 *   <li><b>Distributivity of multiplication over addition:</b>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li><b>Left distributivity:</b> {@code a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)}</li>
 *       <li><b>Right distributivity:</b> {@code (a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h6>Extended Operations:</h6>
 *
 * <h2>Implementations:</h2>
 * <p>Implementations of the {@code Field} interface should ensure that instances are immutable. This means
 * that all operations should return new instances rather than modifying existing ones. Immutability guarantees
 * thread safety and consistent behavior across different contexts.
 *
 * <p>While the interface defines the core operations of a mathematical field, it also specifies additional methods
 * that are common and useful in numerical computations, such as arithmetic with real numbers ({@code double} values), and the
 * computation of square roots. These methods are included to facilitate working with numerical fields like the real
 * numbers or complex numbers. There implementation is optional and default methods are provided which throw a
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <p> The {@link #compareTo(Semiring)} method should implement some ordering (total or partial) on the semiring.
 *
 * <p>Further, implementations should ensure that the equality and hash code methods are consistent with the semiring's equality
 * definition.
 *
 * <h2>Interface Methods:</h2>
 * <p>The {@code Field} interface extends the {@link Ring} interface and specifies additional methods that field elements must implement:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #add(Semiring)}: Performs the addition operation, returning a new field element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #sub(Ring)}: Performs the subtraction operation, defined as addition with the additive inverse.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #mult(Semiring)}: Performs the multiplication operation, returning a new field element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #div(Field)}: Performs the division operation, defined using the multiplicative inverse.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #addInv()}: Returns the additive inverse of this element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #multInv()}: Returns the multiplicative inverse of this element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isZero()}: Checks if the element is the additive identity (zero element).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isOne()}: Checks if the element is the multiplicative identity (one element).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getZero()}: Returns the additive identity element of the field.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getOne()}: Returns the multiplicative identity element of the field.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Assume T is a concrete implementation of Field<T>
 * T a = ...; // Initialize element a
 * T b = ...; // Initialize element b
 *
 * T sum = a.add(b);         // Perform addition in the field
 * T difference = a.sub(b);  // Perform subtraction in the field
 * T product = a.mult(b);    // Perform multiplication in the field
 * T quotient = a.div(b);    // Perform division in the field
 * T negation = a.addInv();  // Get the additive inverse of a
 * T reciprocal = a.multInv(); // Get the multiplicative inverse of a
 *
 * boolean isZero = a.isZero(); // Check if a is the additive identity
 * boolean isOne = b.isOne();   // Check if b is the multiplicative identity
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Examples of Fields:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Rational Numbers (‚Ñö):</b> Fractions of integers where addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined.</li>
 *   <li><b>Real Numbers (‚Ñù):</b> All continuous numbers along the number line, including irrational numbers.</li>
 *   <li><b>Complex Numbers (‚ÑÇ):</b> Numbers of the form {@code a + bi}, where {@code i} is the imaginary unit.</li>
 *   <li><b>Finite Fields (ùîΩ<sub>p</sub>):</b> Fields with a finite number of elements, such as integers modulo a prime number
 *   {@code p}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see Ring
 * @see Semiring
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the field element, which should extend {@code Field<T>} to ensure type consistency.
