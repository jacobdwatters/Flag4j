/**
 * <p>Contains implementations for sparse tensors, matrices, and vectors.
 *
 * <p>A sparse tensor, matrix, or vector is an array where most elements are zero. However, there is no strict definition for the
 * proportion of zero-values elements within the array for it to be considered sparse but generally there should be <i>many</i>
 * times more than non-zero values.
 *
 * <p>Sparse arrays can offer advantages such as reduced memory usage and, in many cases, improved computational performance.
 * These benefits depend on the degree of sparsity and the algorithms used.
 *
 * <p>It should be noted that certain operations on sparse arrays can result in catastrophic loss of sparsity significantly increasing
 * the number of non-zero elements, resulting in higher memory consumption and degraded performance. These effects can be
 * particularly problematic for algorithms optimized for sparse data.
 * Such operations will be documented and should be used with care.
 *
 * <p>This package includes implementations for arrays with real and complex values, as well as generalized support for
 * {@link org.flag4j.algebraic_structures.semirings.Semiring semirings},
 * {@link org.flag4j.algebraic_structures.rings.Ring rings}, and {@link org.flag4j.algebraic_structures.fields.Field fields}.
 * Additionally, some specialized sparse matrix types are provided with limited support for operations:
 * {@link org.flag4j.arrays.sparse.PermutationMatrix permutation matrix} and the {@link org.flag4j.arrays.sparse.SymmTriDiag
 * symmetric tri-diagonal matrix}.
