/**
 * <p>The base abstract class for all tensors, including matrices and vectors.
 *
 * <p>A tensor is a multidimensional array that consists of:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Shape:</b> The {@link #shape} of the tensor specifies the dimensions of the tensor along each axis.
 *     The number of axes in the tensor is referred to as the "{@link #rank}" and corresponds to the number of
 *     indices required to uniquely identify an element within the tensor.</li>
 *     <li><b>Data:</b> A one-dimensional container for the {@link #data} of the tensor.
 *     If the tensor is dense, this contains all the data of the tensor.
 *     If the tensor is sparse, this contains only the non-zero elements of the tensor.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This abstract class provides common functionality and properties for all tensor types.
 * Subclasses should implement the abstract methods to provide specific behaviors for different
 * tensor types and data storage mechanisms (e.g., dense or sparse).
 *
 * @param <T> The specific type of the tensor (used for method return types in a fluent API).
 * @param <U> The type of the data storage container for this tensor. This should be an array, list, or similar list-like structure.
 * @param <V> The type (or wrapper) of the individual data elements in this tensor. If the tensors elements are primitive types, this
 * should be their corresponding wrapper class. If the elements are an {@link Object}, then this should be the same type as the
 * object.
 * @see org.flag4j.arrays.dense
