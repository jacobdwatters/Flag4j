 * This interface specifies methods which any tensor whose data are elements of a ring should implement. This includes

 * <p>To allow for primitive types, the elements of this tensor do not necessarily have to implement
 * {@link org.flag4j.algebraic_structures.rings.Ring}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Formally, an ring is a set <b>R</b> with the binary operations addition (+) and multiplication (*)
 * defined such that for elements a, b, c in <b>R</b> the following are satisfied:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>Addition and multiplication are associative: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.</li>
 *      <li>Addition is commutative: a + b = b + a</li>
 *      <li>Existence of additive and multiplicative identities: There exists two distinct elements 0 and 1 in <b>R</b> such that a + 0 = 0
 *      and a * 1 = 1 (called the additive and multiplicative identities respectively).</li>
 *      <li>Distributivity of multiplication over addition: a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c).</li>

 * @param <T> Type of this tensor.
 * @param <U> Type of dense tensor equivalent to {@code T}. If {@code T} is dense, then this should be the same type as {@code T}.
 * This parameter required because some operations between two sparse tensors may result in a dense tensor.
 * @param <V> Storage for data of this tensor.
 * @param <W> Type (or wrapper) of an element of this tensor. Should satisfy the axioms of a semi-ring as stated.
