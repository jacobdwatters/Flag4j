 * This interface specifies methods which any tensor whose entries are elements of a field should implement.

 * <p>Formally, an field is a set <b>F</b> with the binary operations addition (+) and multiplication (*)
 * defined such that for elements a, b, c in <b>F</b> the following are satisfied:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>Addition and multiplication are associative: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.</li>
 *      <li>Addition and multiplication are commutative: a + b = b + a and a * b = b * a</li>
 *      <li>Existence of additive and multiplicative identities: There exists two distinct elements 0 and 1 in <b>F</b> such that a + 0 = 0
 *      and a * 1 = 1 (called the additive and multiplicative identities respectively).</li>
 *      <li>Existence of additive inverse: There exists an element -a in <b>F</b> such that a + (-a) = 0.</li>
 *      <li>Existence of multiplicative inverse: There exists an element a<sup>-1</sup> in <b>F</b> such that a * a<sup>-1</sup> = 1.</li>
 *      <li>Distributivity of multiplication over addition: a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c).</li>
