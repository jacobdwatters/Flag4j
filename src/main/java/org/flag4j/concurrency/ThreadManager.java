/**
 * <p>Manages a global thread pool and utility methods for executing parallel operations in Flag4j.
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This class provides a shared, fixed-size thread pool to perform parallel operations.</li>
 *   <li>The size of this thread pool (i.e. the "parallelism level") can be set via
 *       {@link #setParallelismLevel(int)} and queried via {@link #getParallelismLevel()}.</li>
 *   <li>The pool uses daemon threads to avoid blocking JVM shutdown.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety & Design:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This class is thread-safe in that calls to {@code setParallelismLevel} and concurrent operations
 *       do not corrupt internal state. However, changing the parallelism level while tasks are actively
 *       running may cause those tasks to be abruptly shut down. Use <em>extreme</em> caution if dynamic
 *       changes to parallelism are required.</li>
 *   <li>The methods {@link #concurrentOperation(int, TensorOperation)} and
 *       {@link #concurrentBlockedOperation(int, int, TensorOperation)} assume the provided
 *       {@link TensorOperation} is itself thread-safe. If there are blocks within the operation which are not thread-safe they
 *       should be wrapped in a {@code synchronized} block.</li>
 * </ul>
