/**
 * Defines a mathematical semiring structure and specifies the operations that semiring elements must support.
 *
 * <p>A <b>semiring</b> is an algebraic structure consisting of a set <b>R</b> equipped with two binary operations:
 * addition (+) and multiplication (*). The semiring generalizes the concept of a {@link Ring ring} but does not require the
 * existence of additive inverses (i.e., negative elements). As a result, subtraction is not generally defined within a semiring.
 *
 * <h2>Formal Definition:</h2>
 * <p>For all elements {@code a}, {@code b}, and {@code c} in <b>R</b>, the following properties must hold:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Addition is associative:</b> {@code a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Addition is commutative:</b> {@code a + b = b + a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Additive identity exists:</b> There exists an element {@code 0} in <b>R</b> such that {@code a + 0 = a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplication is associative:</b> {@code a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplicative identity exists:</b> There exists an element {@code 1} in <b>R</b>
 *   such that {@code a * 1 = a}</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiplication distributes over addition:</b>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li><b>Left distributivity:</b> {@code a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)}</li>
 *       <li><b>Right distributivity:</b> {@code (a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li><b>Zero is absorbing for multiplication:</b> {@code a * 0 = 0 * a = 0}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Implementations:</h2>
 * <p>Implementations of the {@code Semiring} interface should ensure that instances are immutable. This means
 * that all operations should return new instances rather than modifying existing ones. Immutability guarantees
 * thread safety and consistent behavior across different contexts.
 *
 * <p> The {@link #compareTo(Semiring)} method should implement some ordering (total or partial) on the semiring.
 *
 * <p>Further, implementations should ensure that the equality and hash code methods are consistent with the semiring's equality
 * definition.
 *
 * <h2>Examples of Semirings:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Natural Numbers (ℕ):</b> The set of natural numbers with usual addition and multiplication forms a semiring.</li>
 *   <li><b>Boolean Semiring:</b> The set {{@code false}, {@code true}} with logical OR as addition and logical AND as multiplication.</li>
 *   <li><b>Tropical Semiring:</b> The set of real numbers extended with infinity, where addition is defined as taking the minimum
 *   (or maximum) and multiplication as the standard real number addition.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Interface Methods:</h2>
 * <p>The {@code Semiring} interface specifies the following methods that semiring elements must implement:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #add(Semiring)}: Performs the addition operation, returning a new semiring element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #mult(Semiring)}: Performs the multiplication operation, returning a new semiring element.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isZero()}: Checks if the element is the additive identity (zero element).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isOne()}: Checks if the element is the multiplicative identity (one element).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getZero()}: Returns the additive identity element of the semiring.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getOne()}: Returns the multiplicative identity element of the semiring.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Assume T is a concrete implementation of Semiring<T>
 * T a = ...; // Initialize element a
 * T b = ...; // Initialize element b
 *
 * T sum = a.add(b);       // Perform addition in the semiring
 * T product = a.mult(b);  // Perform multiplication in the semiring
 *
 * boolean isZero = a.isZero(); // Check if a is the additive identity
 * boolean isOne = b.isOne();   // Check if b is the multiplicative identity
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see Ring
 * @see Field
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the semiring element.
